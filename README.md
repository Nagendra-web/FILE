# FIN - Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of small to medium-sized programming projects written in various languages like Python, C, C++, and HTML. Each project demonstrates core programming concepts such as data structures, file handling, user interfaces, and game logic. Below is the detailed description of each project included in this repository.

## 1. Personal Portfolio Website (Personalportfoliowebsite.html)

This is a static website built using HTML to serve as a digital personal portfolio. It includes the following sections:

- *About Me* – A short introduction with background details.
- *Skills* – A list of technical and soft skills.
- *Projects* – Showcases key projects with brief summaries.
- *Contact* – An email link and/or contact form.

This project demonstrates how to build a clean and responsive layout using semantic HTML elements. It is suitable for hosting on GitHub Pages or any other static hosting platform.

## 2. Car Game (cargame.cpp)

This is a simple terminal-based car dodging game developed using C++. Key features include:

- *Player controls* to move the car left or right.
- *Obstacle generation* that randomly spawns incoming objects.
- *Collision detection* to end the game if the car hits an obstacle.
- *Score tracking* based on the duration the player survives.

The game uses basic loops, conditionals, arrays, and simple graphics (like cout for drawing). It serves as an introduction to game mechanics and real-time input handling in C++.

## 3. Employee Management System (employee.c)

This is a C-based project for managing employee records using file handling. Features include:

- *Add new employee*
- *View all employee records*
- *Search by employee ID or name*
- *Delete or update records*

It demonstrates the use of structs, file I/O operations (fopen, fread, fwrite, etc.), and menu-driven programs in C.

## 4. PDF Organizer (pdf organizer.py)

This is a Python script that automatically organizes PDF files in a directory based on specific rules such as:

- *Prefix/suffix-based sorting* (e.g., “invoice_2024.pdf” goes to the “Invoices” folder)
- *Date-based folder creation*
- *Merging or splitting PDFs* (optional)

It uses libraries like os, shutil, and PyPDF2 or pikepdf and is useful for document-heavy users like students or office workers.

## How to Run

Each project can be run independently based on the language:

- Python files: python filename.py
- C files: gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
- C++ files: g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output
- HTML file: Open directly in any browser.
